### Overview

The following project takes a look at how I enabled Google's Migration Center transformation and modernization. Modernization, and by it's extension, the practice of lifing and modernization of infrasturcture is one of the most modern ways to look at your infrastructure, and deploy changes to the environment.

**Period of work: April 2025 - Current**<br>
**Type of Engagement: UX conceptual Mockups + Programme Definition**

## Understanding the domain

### Hello World to HTML
Let‚Äôs take a step back and strip things down to their simplest form. For many of us, the very first interaction with code wasn‚Äôt a complex software architecture or a multi-layered cloud system. It was a humble ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù program ‚Äî perhaps written on Scratch with colorful blocks, or a basic website built using HTML and CSS.

There was a certain charm to it. You‚Äôd write a few lines of code, double-click the .html file, and instantly see your creation come alive in a browser. This cycle of write ‚Üí preview ‚Üí iterate felt intuitive and magical.

<!-- <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 20px 0;">
<iframe height="400" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="Hello World" src= "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1203843594/" frameborder="no" loading="lazy" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">
</iframe>
</div> -->

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 20px 0;">
<iframe height="400" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="Hello World" src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/48zdgn?view=editor+%2B+preview&module=%2Findex.html&hidenavigation=1" frameborder="no" loading="lazy" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">
</iframe>
</div>

What‚Äôs fascinating is how these small experiments already reflected core patterns of larger systems. You had code (the source), you had a domain (the browser acting as the runtime), and you had a preview (the user interface). This simple loop is still the essence of how applications, no matter how complex, operate today.

### Scaling Up: The Layers Begin

Now, imagine you're working on Bamazon.com, a fictional e-commerce site.

* At first, it feels like it‚Äôs just more of the same:
  * You have some HTML/CSS.
  * A dash of JavaScript for interactivity.

But then questions start popping up:

* Where does the product data come from?
  * Where is the ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù state stored?
  * How does it remember my cart when I refresh the page?

<div style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; border-radius: 12px; overflow: hidden; box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
  <iframe 
    src="https://editor.p5js.org/yashraj.p.wadalkar/full/o3sknZ0Kz"
    style="width: 100%; height: 450px; border: none; overflow: hidden;"
    scrolling="no"
    sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups"
    loading="lazy"
  ></iframe>
</div>

### From Monoliths to Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)

Not long ago, most apps ran on monolith servers¬π‚Äîsingle systems where everything was bundled together. This made scaling and updating difficult.
The shift began with virtualization¬≤, allowing us to split large servers into smaller, isolated environments. Eventually, cloud computing made infrastructure more dynamic and scalable.

* Today, with increasing complexity, teams rely on Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs¬≥). These platforms provide:
  * Golden Images‚Å¥ (pre-configured environments),
  * Automated CI/CD Pipelines‚Åµ,
  * Embedded best practices.

The goal? Minimize infrastructure hassle, so developers can focus on building and shipping software quickly and reliably.
We‚Äôve moved from manual, monolithic management to self-service, automated platforms that streamline development from code to production.

From an enterprise perspective:
1. Foundational Elements - Environment & Deployment Topology [On Prem/Cloud/Hybrid] - Where Is it running
2. Foundational Infrastructure - Compute, Networks, Storage, IAM/Permissions - what hardware and platform primitives are used
3. Runtime Infrastructure 9Ms, K8s, FaaS - How are things running
4. Platform Layer (CI/CD, Middleware, Containers,) - How is it built, deploued, secired
5. Business services layer (Applications/Microservices) - What logical services power the business
6. Interaction Layer -(UX + APIs) - Web UIs, SDKs, APIs, Front-end services

## UX Challenge & Process üöÄ

One of the biggest challenges we faced was **lack of clarity** ‚Äî the project had no clear direction or defined outcomes.

We turned this around by:
- Conducting **review discussions** that reshaped our understanding.
- Establishing a **clear product vision and direction**.
- Regular syncs with **internal teams** and **CE representatives** for alignment.

We used:
- **OOUX (Object-Oriented UX)** to structure system understanding.
- **Stakeholder workshops** for shared clarity.
- Defined a **collaborative process** that kept everyone in sync.

> This structured approach transformed an ambiguous start into a well-aligned, actionable project.

## Journeys, pain-points and challenges.

At it's core, we can say, at it's core, the essence of any web application has a definite manner of looking at things:
- Where the code runs
- How it gets there
- How is it maintained
- Who can access it

### Specific pain points

Based on our interviews, we had identified certain

#### 1. Help me understand the first five apps to migrate
#### 2. Code and Architecture Review
#### 3. Decomposing the Monolith (The "Strangler Fig" Pattern)
#### 4. How IaC + CI/CD is magic


### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

## Results

- Reduced downtime
- Automated rollback capabilities
